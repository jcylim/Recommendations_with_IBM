### Project Motivation: <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. The skills I have applied for the analysis and recommendation done in this project are data engineering and cleaning, rank-based recommendation, user-user based collaborative filtering, as well as matrix factorization using Single Value Decomposition (SVD). 

### File Description: <a name="files"></a>
There is 1 notebook called **Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb** available here to showcase work related to this project. The notebook is exploratory in working with the data and using different recommendation methods pertaining to the project, and markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the individual steps for accomplishing the objective of this project.

Inside the **data** folder, the two CSV files: **articles_community.csv** and **user-item-interactions.csv** are the datasets used for this project. Please refer to the *Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements* section for more information about the IBM Watson Studio platform and dataset.
